## Hello, folks! <Twemoji className="mx-2" emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Arun Singh Sisodiya

I have a passion for **cloud computing**, **automation**, and **infrastructure as code**.
I'm currently a Lead CloudOps engineer at **Mercedes-Benz.io**, deeply engaged in the **Platform Engineering** project.
I work mainly with **Kubernetes**, **CI/CD**, **Terraform**, **Python**, **AWS**, and **other DevOps methodologies**.

## Why have this blog?

> I am driven by the desire to hone my skills and disseminate the knowledge I've acquired. ðŸŒŸ

I founded this blog as a means to document and share the knowledge and practical wisdom I've acquired during my journey as a cloud engineer.

Writing and taking notes helps me solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies. I hope my blog can be a useful resource for fellow cloud engineers.

I would greatly appreciate your thoughts and comments on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
